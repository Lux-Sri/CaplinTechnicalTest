# CaplinTechnicalTest
London Stock Exchange Website Test Scenarios

This project is a technical test for Caplin Systems.

It is written using Java/Selenium and includes four automated tests for four test scenarios.

Note: For test scenario three, I made the assumption that I needed to look for constituents with Market cap exceeding 7 billion rather than 7 million, as all constituents were above 7 million.
